/*
 * Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
 * 
 * Problem Description:
 * You are given an array 'prices' where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
 * You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing 
 * a different day in the future to sell that stock.
 * Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve 
 * any profit, return 0.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
 * 
 * Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 * 
 * Solution Approach:
 * - Brute force with nested loops
 * - For each day i, consider buying at prices[i]
 * - For each subsequent day j, calculate profit by selling at prices[j]
 * - Keep track of maximum profit found
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) - due to nested loops
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - only using a few variables
 * 
 * Note: This can be optimized to O(n) by keeping track of minimum price seen so far
