# JavaScript Coding Bootcamp – 45 Problems

The goal of this program is to get you from "can code but not very much" to
"comfortable with the basic tools of algorithms in TypeScript." If you can do
all 45 problems, you should be in a good state to pass technical interviews and
also (and more importantly) do day-to-day software work, with or without AI.

This is about you and your learning, not about shipping fast.
No AI tools allowed, no Stack Overflow allowed, only EloquentJS and MDN, e.g.:  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array  

## Rules & Guidelines

- **No external help** except EloquentJS book and MDN documentation. You can get more details about a problem by googling it, but _do not look up the answer_.
- **Write tests** for each solution to verify correctness  
- **Time yourself** – aim to complete each problem within reasonable limits  
- **Optimize solutions** – consider time and space complexity  
- **Document your code** – add comments explaining your approach  
- **Debug systematically** – use `console.log` and step-through debugging  
- **Make PRs** - So instructors can check your work
- **Ask for help** - if a problem is unclear (even after googling) or you're entirely stuck for more than 90 minutes, ask an instructor.

## Day 1 — Fundamentals & Basics

1. **FizzBuzz** – print numbers 1–100, but replace multiples of 3 with "Fizz", 5 with "Buzz", and both with "FizzBuzz".  
2. **Reverse a String** – reverse a string manually without using built-in reverse methods.  
3. **Palindrome Checker** – check if a string reads the same forward and backward.  
4. **Count Vowels** – count the number of vowels in a given string.  
5. **Largest Number in Array** – find the largest number without using `Math.max()`.  
6. **Remove Duplicates from Array** – remove duplicate values while preserving order.  
7. **Factorial (Iterative)** – compute factorial using a loop.  
8. **Prime Number Checker** – determine if a number is prime.  
9. **Binary Search** – search for a target in a sorted array and return its index or -1.  
10. **Array Intersection** – return common unique values between two arrays.  
11. **Two Sum** – find two numbers in an array that add up to a target sum.  
12. **Anagram Checker** – check if two strings are anagrams of each other.  
13. **Caesar Cipher** – implement a simple shift cipher for encoding/decoding text.  
14. **Valid Email Checker** – validate a simple email format without regex.  
15. **Find Missing Number** – find the missing integer in a sequence from 1 to n.

## Day 2 — Data Structures & Moderate Problems

16. **Implement Stack** – build a stack with push, pop, and peek operations.  
17. **Implement Queue** – build a queue with enqueue and dequeue operations.  
18. **Singly Linked List** – implement insertion, deletion, and search in a linked list.  
19. **Valid Parentheses** – determine if all parentheses in a string are balanced.  
20. **Longest Common Prefix** – find the longest shared starting substring in an array of strings.  
21. **Word Frequency Counter** – count how often each word appears in a string of text.  
22. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays** – combine two sorted arrays into one sorted array.  
23. **First Non-Repeating Character** – return the first character in a string that appears only once.  
24. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** – find the length of the longest substring with all unique characters.  
25. **String Compression** – compress strings like `"aabcccccaaa"` into `"a2b1c5a3"`, but only if shorter.  
26. **Roman Numeral Converter** – convert integers to Roman numerals and back.  
27. **Matrix Rotation** – rotate a square matrix 90° clockwise.  
28. **Array Chunk** – split an array into subarrays of given size.  
29. **Binary Search Variants** – find the first or last occurrence of a target in a sorted array.  
30. **Rotate Array by k** – rotate an array to the right by k positions, in place if possible.

## Day 3 — Intermediate Problem Solving + Basic Graphs

31. **Merge Sort** – sort an array using the merge sort algorithm.  
32. **Search in Rotated Sorted Array** – find a target in a rotated sorted array using binary search.  
33. **Kth Largest Element** – return the kth largest element in an array (sorting allowed).  
34. **Merge Overlapping Intervals** – merge intervals that overlap into one.  
35. **Move Zeroes** – shift all zero values to the end of an array while keeping other elements in order.  
36. **Matrix Spiral Order (Read)** – print elements of a matrix in spiral order.  
37. **Transpose a Matrix** – swap rows and columns of a matrix.  
38. **Flatten Nested Array** – flatten an arbitrarily nested array into a single array.  
39. **Find Peak Element** – return the index of an element that is greater than its neighbors.  
40. **String Rotation Check** – determine if one string is a rotation of another.  
41. **Pascal’s Triangle** – generate the first n rows of Pascal’s triangle.  
42. **Valid Sudoku Board** – verify that a partially filled 9×9 Sudoku board is valid.  
43. **Graph Depth-First Search (DFS)** – traverse all nodes in a graph using DFS.  
44. **Graph Breadth-First Search (BFS)** – traverse all nodes in a graph using BFS.  
45. **Find Connected Components in Graph** – count the number of connected components in an undirected graph.
